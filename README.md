# First-Challenge
This weeks challenge I cleaned up the html and css code by condensing uneeded items, adding comments to help anyone who reads the code understand it
much easier and created new elements to make the code more efficient.

## HTML
Specifically in the html code, I first started by going through and commenting out each section and what each section did to help make the code easier
to read and more accessible. Then I went and added placeholder images to any img elements that didn't have an alternative image. I also went through
and made sure the headers were in order instead of having an h2 or h3 come before an h1.

## CSS
In the CSS code, I went through and commented out each section just like the html code to make it easier to read. I then started condensing certain 
classes as there were classes for each individual element when that wasn't necessary for some elements. For example, instead of having a class with 
the same properties for each element in the .benefits section, I moved all properties that were the same in each class to the .benefits class which 
gave the same result with less clutter and made it look cleaner.
